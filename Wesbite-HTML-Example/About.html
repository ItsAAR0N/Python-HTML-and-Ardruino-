            <p> What is this page about? </p>
            <p> As the name of the website implies, it keeps you up to date with the latest news regarding any ground breaking Glasgow developments. Glasgow is rapidly developing, 
                and is one of UK's top 3 cities for FDI (Foreign Direct Investment) outside of London, surpassing the likes of Manchester and Birmingham. I have seen with my very own eyes,
                how rapidily Glasgow's growth is accelerating. The proof is there to be seen with the countless consutrction sites and cranes scattered around the city. I personally find construction interesting.
